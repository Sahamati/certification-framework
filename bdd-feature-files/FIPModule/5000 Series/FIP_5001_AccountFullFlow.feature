Feature:On calling Full Flow APIs except account discovery and consent notification, Send the account link
  request,and account link token request. Set the Consent notification response in mock server, and in consent
  post request. Set the FI Notification response in Mock server. Send the FI request, wait for FI ready notification,
  send the FI fetch request, and finally delink the account request in sequence for single account user for each
  supported FIType. Check that all the APIs are responding with success response. Verify that the response code of
  all APIs is 200.

         AuthenticatorType settings, skip this test case stating the reason.
    And  Verify that the Account link token response status is LINKED.
    And  Verify that the FI data matches the FIType schema.
    And  Verify that the Account delink response status is DELINKED.
    And  Verify that the RefNumber received in account link response is not repeated when variations are tried.
    And  Verify that the linkRefNumber received in account link token response is not repeated when variations are tried.
    And  Verify that the sessionId received in FI response is not repeated when variations are tried.
    And  Verify that the cryptoAlgo recevied in Fi fetch is the valid Algo.
