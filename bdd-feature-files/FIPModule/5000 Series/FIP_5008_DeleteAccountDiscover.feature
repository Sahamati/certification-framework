Feature:On calling DELETE Accounts Discover APIs, set the Account or link or notification response on
  Mock server. Send the Account link request, wait for account link notification to Mock AA
  server (Direct authentication). Set the Consent notification response in mock server, and consent post
  request. Set the FI Notification on Mock server. Send the FI request, wait for FI ready notification. Send the
  FI fetch request and finally delink the account request in sequence for user with three accounts in all
  supported FITypes and check that all APIs are responding with success response.   Verify that the response
  code of all APIs is 200.
