Feature:On calling DELETE Accounts Discover APIs, set the Account or link or notification response on
  Mock server. Send the Account link request, wait for account link notification to Mock AA
  server (Direct authentication). Set the Consent notification response in mock server, and consent post
  request. Set the FI Notification on Mock server. Send the FI request, wait for FI ready notification. Send the
  FI fetch request and finally delink the account request in sequence for user with three accounts in all
  supported FITypes and check that all APIs are responding with success response.   Verify that the response
  code of all APIs is 200.

    Then Verify that the reponse code of all APIs is 200.
    And  Verify that the Account link response AuthenticatorType is DIRECT. If DIRECT is not specified in
         supported AuthenticatorType settings, skip this test case by stating the reason.
    And  Verify that the Account link token response status is LINKED.
    And  Verify that the FI data matches the FIType schema.
    And  Verify that the Account delink response status is DELINKED.
    And  Verify that the RefNumber received in account link response is not repeated when variations are tried.
    And  Verify that the linkRefNumber received in account link token response is not repeated when variations are tried.
    And  Verify that the sessionId received in FI response is not repeated when variations are tried.
    And  Verify that the cryptoAlgo recevied in Fi fetch is the valid Algo.

  Scenario: 5008_2 On calling DELETE Accounts Discover APIs, send the account full flow requests with
  first 2 accounts of user having three account for All FIType for DIRECT authenticatorType. Verify that
